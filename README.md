# blender-typings

## What Is

Best I can tell, none of the existing blender type stubs for python can
actually be used effectively for type checking. This repo is a half-hearted
attempt to fix up issues as I find them when working on my own blender work,
to see if I can make type stubs for blender truly useful. Currently, this is
based on fake-bpy-module (https://github.com/nutti/fake-bpy-module).

## When to Use

Don't. It's a mess. It'll probably break horribly on you. If you want to help
make this a more formal project, though, let me know?
